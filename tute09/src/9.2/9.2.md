# Q9.2

**What is template specialisation**

**When not to specialise**

**What does the `...` syntax mean**


```C++
template <typename ...Ts>
struct sink {}; /* 1 */

template <typename T>
struct sink<int, T> {}; /* 2 */

template <typename T, typename ...Ts>
struct sink<int, Ts...> {}; /* 3 */

using sunk = sink<int, void>;
```

**Which specialisation would be selected and why?**

a) 3: This is the only specialisation where the first template parameter matches perfectly, and Ts... has higher priority than a single T.
b) 2: This is the only specialisation where the first template parameter matches perfectly, and Ts... has lower priority than a single T.
c) 1: The primary template is the most general of all of the specialisations and so it is the best match.
d) Compilation error: 2 & 3 are equally viable.
